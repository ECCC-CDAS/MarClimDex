# MarClimEX
===========

MarClimEX is designed to provide a user friendly interface to compute indices of marine climate extremes. It computes all 37 core marine climate extrme indices recommended by the CCl/CLIVAR Expert Team for Climate Change Detection Monitoring and Indices (ETCCDI) including extreme wave height indices, extreme wind indices and extreme water level indices.
